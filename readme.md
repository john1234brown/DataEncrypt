# Introduction

So today It is 3:20 AM in the Morning on July 30, 2024 I Johnathan Edward Brown have tested with making a full on utility Security module which can be used by anyone and still ensure that it is secured! utilized babel to obfuscate code and environment variables this said code is executed in runtime context so not to give anyone access to obfuscated runtime code!

Utilizes a Three way Security Key system which rotates in a sqlite database along with holding the encrypted data you wish to store in there as well all though this is for storing a single data object or a array of objects you wish to encrypt sadly only one object may be encrypted using this Choose wisely!


To utilize Please start utilizing the reobby.js file!
