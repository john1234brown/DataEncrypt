- Ive realized that this design needs a password protected sqlite solution as well!
- To help offload the constant changing of said data to not cause issues with a HDD on older systems!
- Ive remeber in the past using this design in a simulation on a Non NVME SSD setup and it wasnt good needless to say caused OS corruption and full file loss almost thanks to Disk Drill software files where recoverable!

- So plans to implement a simple non password protected design will be soon. Since for a password protected database thats encrypted is kinda overkill but we will plan to show how that can be done as well! Cause Why Not Proper Open Source Security is the way for our Future!
