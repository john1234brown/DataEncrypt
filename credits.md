- I Tried to limit myself on how much i relied on AI for this project and I'm happy to say and suprised that Only 5 AI chat historys where used up during the entire span of this! Two of which that arent linked was the original Rotation Key Code Boilerplate with a single kek(Aka Key Encrypt Key) and MasterKey setup with Argon2 with a deriveKey function I took this and added extra environment key ontop and included some Sqlite solutions. Also included a Custom deriveSalt setup to help further protect environment key plan to incorporate a password protected database next as well! And Thats about it folks Also this all runs on less than 9 to 20% cpu usage on a Acer 315 chromebook with rotation on every .5 seconds so theres that for optimized!!!
- Best to look at the optimization.md file to understand how you might have to configure this for best cpu processor core usage to properly keep at low cpu usage like I've done or slowly increment up to make more difficult based on your cpu specs! Enjoy and if you donate well Thank you!

### Knowledge Passed Down From Other Senior Developers
## Vampeyer https://github.com/Vampeyer/Vampeyer
- The really greatest thing any senior developer could do out there and that was ensuring the future of another junior developer to succeed in what ever they dream taking on! By Not allowing said Junior Developer Give up especially after taking what is to feel like ones greatest failure which then pointed out "a failed project or design is not a failed goal in mind one may say! As now one may have more context and can shed light in mind this time around for said project design and scope. merrr!" - The great Vampeyer!
- This one Here Has taught me Most if not all of the security related knowledge I know today! And I'm proud to say if it weren't for him I wouldn't have been able to be able to develop such a usualable library in nodeJs today if it wasn't for him!
- Might I say also this one is alot like a mentor to me I might add and the mentorship of this senior dev is outstanding!
- Keep a eye on this ones repositories he is a great skilled senior developer! And is always working hard and tiredlessly!
- Can really open ones eyes to simpler design structures!

## StormForged https://github.com/StormForgeStudio
- The Greatest of senior developers out there truly when I was 14 years old this one here bought me my first real desktop computer which allowed me to progress into programming more complex and intensive stuff one of the most humble and meaningful things any senior developer out there could do!
- His love for sqlite lead me on the journey of using the sqlite back in the day with alot of my minecraft plugins and such which is the reason I know sqlite today to do such a thing!
- Might I also say this one is another mentor to me as well!

## Thomas Sync https://github.com/thomasync
- Havent got to personally meet this Senior developer but ive been analyzing and studying his project designs and concepts and I feel as always give credit where inspirations may come to mind from!

## Mitchell Duncan https://github.com/mdu830
- Personally Meet this Senior Developer before the first to get me to transition over from using ubuntu linux back in the day to a kali linux os To start me on my journey of security developments! And i'm proud to have meet this one!
- This one has offered me many different chances to get into the development fields and get paid.
- But I've always enjoy it as a hobby and for the open source community as I wish and plan to eventually get paid for things but until then I must say I am always grateful this one seen potential in me and will always be grateful of the Development field job offers I sadly sometimes regret turning down but as always will never let that get me down! Neither would he and he certainly don't take no hard ship to me declining! In fact we both are still on great terms!

## Ethan Gallant https://github.com/ethan-gallant
- I Very Well Remeber the days of gaming with this at the time was Junior Developer and I must say amazing to see how this one Grew as a Senior Developer so Quickly faster then I personally believe I while ever achieve the same Senior Developer Level of this one!
- We was setting up OVH Servers for gaming hostings back in the day he taught me some of the networking I know mostly the Simple stuff and glad I was able to learn it with him along the ways and to see him grow so quick into dockers back then and kubernetes far before I ever thought to learn one I admit I wish i would have kept learning with him on his journey but as always sometimes things drift away and ya both caught up in seperate routes!
